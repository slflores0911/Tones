# Tones

This repository contains a variety of unique tones ranging from 30 - 8000htz to use for games that will aid in the training of absolute pitch. 
All tones were generated using the Praat Computer Sofware. The scripts that were used to create them are located in the `Praat_Scripts` folder

### Individualized Tones
This folder contains a series of subfolders that store the notes C-B in eight different octaves. Each subfolder includes tones for one specific note, spanning all eight octaves.

### Randomized Tones
Contains a series of subfolders that each store 7 randomized audios of the notes C-B that span all eight octaves.
The scripts to generate these randomized tone files are located in `Python_Scipts`
